GP-Ants
=======

Genetic programming and swarm intelligence assignment. Part 1 is swarm intelligence where ants will wander around until they find food, then bring it back to the nest. Part 2 does genetic programming to do linear regression of two different assignments. Part 3 uses genetic programming to develop the behaviour of ants to act the same as in part 1.
